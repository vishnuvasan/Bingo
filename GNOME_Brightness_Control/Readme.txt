I found this in the Internet and I am not the Author.
Whenever I power off my system,the brighness of my system which is supposed to be stored is not taken.
That means whenever I restart my system I had the same default 100% brightness irrespective of whatever configurations you do in the Initialisation Files.

so searched for Solutions in Internet and found this Crispy Little Code Using dbus.
Set the Default Brightness(%) which you want in the Script and add this to your startup applications.
You are ready to go.
Problem will be Solved.You will have your favourite default brightness all the time from now on.
