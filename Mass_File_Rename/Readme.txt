Tool	: Mass File Rename Tool
OS	: Cross Platform ( Windows,Mac and Linux.But Not Tested in Mac)
Warning	: USE THIS WITH CARE.ONCE RENAMED NO FILE NAME CAN BE REVERTED

This is a Small Utility which I created when I browsing the Myriad of Movies in my Hard Disk with so clumsy Names from Torrents.

So Created a Script to Rename the Files to some extent Nicely.

This will rename only the files and not the Directories and it will traverse to all the sub level directories for this matter.

Use this Tool Carefully as once the File Renaming Happens , No File Name can be reverted back to its old name
